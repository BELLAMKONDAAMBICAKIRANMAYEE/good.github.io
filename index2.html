    <P>For a student, <mark>COLLEGE LIFE</mark> is the beginning of adulthood. In our college life, along with academics, we indulge ourselves in recreational activities.
        Students also participate in various group activities that will help them learn about themselves and their peers. After graduation, students are prepared to face the real world. In today’s scenario, the job market is quite challenging, but still, you can make your college life an exciting time in your life.
        <br> individual or student is not lucky to get the chance to experience <br>college life. Due to various reasons, they are not able to attend college. Some might have financial problems, while others have responsibilities to fulfil. College life always remains memorable for all of us. The ones who have 
        had a college life always wish to turn back 
        time to live it all once again. We all learn the most significant lessons of our life during our college times. In our college life, we develop brotherhood, friendship and a spirit of unity. We also get a sense of duty and responsibility and learn good manners. One crucial lesson students should learn in college is not to misuse liberty.
        A student’s future is determined by utilising their college time productively to become successful in life. Students should not ignore their studies at their college because it can turn their dreams into reality</P>
